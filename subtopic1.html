                This article explains the full history of cel animation, a traditional animation method based entirely on hand-drawn frames painted on transparent sheets called cels. It explores how this technique dominated the animation world for decades, shaping cartoons and animated films long before computers were used. The article describes the roles of animators, inkers, painters, and photographers in producing smooth motion. It also documents the transition from analog techniques to digital ink-and-paint systems, showing how early computer tools replaced the more labor-intensive cel workflow while still keeping the spirit of traditional animation alive.

                This page outlines Disney’s historic cel animation pipeline, describing how early animated films required thousands of handmade drawings. It details the traditional workflow including rough sketches, cleanup drawings, inking, painting, background design, and final camera photography. The resource highlights the teamwork and precision required to create even short sequences of animation. Disney also discusses its major technological shift in the late 1980s when the studio adopted its CAPS digital ink-and-paint system, marking the beginning of the transition away from physical cels and toward modern digital techniques.
