                This museum page profiles John Whitney, a major pioneer of digital art and motion graphics. It explains how he used early computers to create generative and algorithmic animations, proving that machines could be used for creative expression. Whitney’s innovations laid the groundwork for modern digital effects, animation software, and music visualizations. His work demonstrated the artistic potential of computational systems long before digital art became mainstream, influencing countless artists and technologies that followed.
