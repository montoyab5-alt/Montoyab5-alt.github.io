                Pixar’s official history page explains how the studio pioneered CGI animation, beginning with early experiments involving 3D wireframes and computer-generated objects. It details the innovations that led to Toy Story, the first fully computer-animated feature film. The page explores key breakthroughs such as advanced rendering techniques, realistic lighting, and shading models made possible by RenderMan. Pixar’s work helped establish CGI as a dominant force in animation, demonstrating its power to create complex visuals that traditional 2D methods could not achieve.
